Many thanks to @alecdwm for his tireless reviews of both the code and UX. His sanity checking and enthusiasm for the project were, and continue to be, invaluable.

Many thanks to @fdehau and [The Ratatui Developers](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) for providing such a high-quality and easy to use TUI library in Rust. Ratatui is both simple and extremely featureful, supporting a rich set of widgets out of the box.

Thanks also to the [Ethereum Melbourne](https://ethmelbourne.co) group for their curiosity and interest in the project.
